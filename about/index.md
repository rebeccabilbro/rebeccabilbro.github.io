Welcome to my development journal! This is where I come to keep track of the things I'm doing and learning.

### What is capsicum?

Capsicum is a genus of flowering plants in the nightshade family *Solanaceae*. Native to the Americas for thousands of years, Capsicum species are now cultivated worldwide, used in food, medicine, and in lachrymatory agents like sleeping gas, riot control, and mace.

My father taught me to have a sense of humor about experimentation and failure. I do a lot of both. That's why this journal is called Capsicum. Programming is hard.

### That quote

The quote I'm using as the tagline for this journal is from a book by Paulo Coelho. The full line goes:

> If pain must come, may it come quickly. Because I have a life to live, and I need to live it in the best way possible. If he has to make a choice, may he make it now. Then I will either wait for him or forget him.
>
> &mdash; <cite> Paulo Coelho [_By the River Piedra I Sat Down and Wept: A Novel of Forgiveness_](https://www.amazon.com/River-Piedra-Sat-Down-Wept/dp/0061122092)</cite>

### About me

I'm a data scientist, Python programmer, and author who lives in Washington, DC. If I'm not at work or here, I'm either cooking, practicing ukulele, or riding bikes with my family.
