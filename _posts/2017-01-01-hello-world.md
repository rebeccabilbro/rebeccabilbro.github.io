Welcome to Capsicum, my development journal.

### Hi there

I decided to start this journal to have a place to capture my process as I practice programming and try out new techniques and methods. The notes and ideas I publish in this journal are deliberately published openly and are free for anyone to read or use as they like (check out the [license](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rebeccabilbro/rebeccabilbro.github.io/master/LICENSE) in case you have questions), but I can't promise that the content you find here will be polished or even particularly coherent. However, I'm actually a pretty good writer; I studied technical writing in graduate school and also write regularly on the District Data Labs [blog](http://blog.districtdatalabs.com). There you will find posts I've written on [machine learning](http://blog.districtdatalabs.com/an-introduction-to-machine-learning-with-python), [visual diagnostics](http://blog.districtdatalabs.com/visual-diagnostics-for-more-informed-machine-learning-part-1), [getting into open source](http://blog.districtdatalabs.com/getting-started-in-open-source), [goals for the intermediate data scientist](http://blog.districtdatalabs.com/ten-things-to-try-in-2017), and other topics.

### Tears, pain, and temporary blindness

Capsicum is used in lachrymatory agents and can cause tears, pain, and temporary blindness. Because this is a journal about my adventures in programming, it seemed an apt name. Read more [here](https://rebeccabilbro.github.io/about/).
