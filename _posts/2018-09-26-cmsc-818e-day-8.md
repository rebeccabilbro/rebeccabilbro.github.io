# Day Eight

 - Strong consistency means R+W > N (a strict quorum system) - the read and write quorums overlap
 - Partial consistency otherwise
    - assumes that applications can tolerate some staleness
 - staleness in terms of time and staleness in terms of replicas
    - a read is k-regular if it returns the result of one of the K most recent writes
    - system provides (K, p)-regular semantics if each read is K-regular w/ prob
    - a read is delta-regular if it returns the result of the last write as of up to delta time units ago
    - system provides (delta, p)-regular semantics if each read is delta-regular w/ prob p
 - PBS: Probabilistically Bounded Staleness [link](http://pbs.cs.berkeley.edu/)
 - Bolt-on consistency: enforce causal consistency across systems that only support eventual consistency using a shim layer
    - motivated by a need for stronger consistency, lower latency (tolerance for staleness)
    - Write path: client write performed in local store, send to ECDS w/ metadata
    - Read path (causal): Client read satisfied by local store (might result in staleness)
    - Read path (pessimistic): synchronous checking on data, and dependencies, in the ECDS, rather than replying on async resolve process to do this for us (read latency is seriously impacted by this)
 - [HAT](https://www.usenix.org/conference/hotos13/session/bailis): Highly available transactions
 - causal consistency is the strongest consistency you can guarantee in the face of partitions
 - differentiate between potential and explicit causality. Potential causality is what we usually think of, and which they do not consider further (because the possible dependency trees would get too bushy)
 - Dynamo, Cassandra etc now provide an extra layer that supports causal consistency.
