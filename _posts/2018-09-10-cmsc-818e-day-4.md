# Day Four

## Elephant Paper

[link to post](https://rebeccabilbro.github.io/elephant-file-system/)

 - differentiating between undo and long term history
 - policies:
    - keep one (browser cache, core, /tmp)
    - keep all
    - keep safe (just undo)
    - keep landmarks <--
 - landmarks - people write/edit in blocks; cluster the times together and take the last one; call that a landmark
 - versioning for files but not for directories (why was that again?)
 - should changes propagate all the way to the root?
    - make it cheaper by using file chunking/hashing (like LBNFS)
    - set flag for "dirty" to signal that a node has been modified

```
cd foo/@12-nov-1999:11:30
tls    `ls @v`
tgrep
```

 - user-level process called when the cleaner comes across high-temp file
 - Downsides: less locality in inodes, data blocks; pressure on buffer cache
 - could use lbfs chunking to lessen the buffer cache pressure
 - what about something like video editing?
 - use diffs between versions of a chain to a land-mark
 - applications used to write to filesystems; once you have sufficient operating systems, you can take the load off the applications
 - [operational transforms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operational_transformation)
 - incomplete description of results (not enough set-up for the graphs), for example:
    - is the cleaner running? how often?
    - what is the keep-safe window?
 - challenges with duplicating code from papers (e.g. epaxos)
 - [Inferno](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inferno_(operating_system)) -  Bell Labs/Rob Pike
 - [Network Application](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NetApp)
 - snapshot: store a pointer to a previous root, use that to drive policies that reclaim old versions no longer needed


## Knockoff Paper

[link to post](https://rebeccabilbro.github.io/knockoff/)

 - an attempt to generalize operation shipping
 - the specific details are in a previous paper on [Arnold](http://web.eecs.umich.edu/~ddevec/papers/devecsery14.pdf)
 - eidetic versioning: any past state in the file system or in application memory
 - stores non-deterministic log for replay
 - nondeterministic log: system call results (always happen at the same time), external data reads (references to other file in the FS), thread scheduling (sometimes less predictable), unexpected signals (how to recreate?)
 - Store by values when programs to produce are not in cloud, computation costlier than communication
 - versioning policies: none; on close; on write; eidetic (system call)
 - Note: cost comparison can be difficult for long-running applications. Greedy policy is good in the short term, but might not be the globally optimal solution. Uses per-application histories to catch long-running apps that might benefit from ops (multiple versions?)
 - Problems: Reproducing past file may need input data from other logs; version vector show dependency graph between files; materialization delay is delay to reproduce inputs an the file
 - Costs - 7-8% recording; up to a minute to re-constitute; doesn't mention the word interactive
 - sha1 deprecation
 - creating images of the environment - e.g. docker or vagrant
