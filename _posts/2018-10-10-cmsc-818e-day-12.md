# Day Twelve

## Serializability

### Conflict Serializability
 - Two read/write instruction "conflict" if 
    - they are by different transactions
    - they operate on the same data item
    - at least one is a write instruction

why do we care?
 - if two read/write instructions don't conflict they can be swapped without any change in the final effect
 - if they do conflict they an't be swapped

### Conflict-equivalent schedules 
  - if S can be transformed into S' through a series of swaps, S and S' are called conflict-equivalent
  - conflict-equivalence guarantees the same final effect

Conflicting write instructions don't matter because they'll be overwritten anyway. The final write is the only one that matters.

View-serializability for S' and S and each datum Q:
 - if Ti reads initial value of Q in S, must also in S'
 - if Ti reads value written from Tj in S, must also in S' 
 - it Fi performs final write to Q in S, must also in S'

Testing for conflict-serializability
 - given a schedule, determine if it is conflict-serializable (this is slow N factorial)
 - draw a precedence-graph over the transactions (much more efficient!)
    - if there is a cycle in the graph, not conflict serializable
    - if there is none, it is conflict-serializable

How to guarantee serializability?
 - Allowing transactions to run, and then aborting them if the schedules aren't serializable can be expensive 

We can instead use schemes to guarantee that the schedule will be conflict-serializable.

### Recoverability 
 - Serializability is good for consistency
 - What if transactions fail?
 - in a recoverable schedule, we never commit a transaction that depends on a reads-from if the read-from transaction hasn't been committed yet
 - cascading rollbacks
 - dirty read: reading a value written by a transaction that hasn't committed yet
 - cascadeless schedules: transaction that only reads committed values
 - cascadeless implies no cascading rollbacks (which is good!)


 ### Concurrency Control

  - Approach: guarantee conflict-serialziablity by limiting concurrency with locks 
  - Assumptions: ignoring durability (no crashes) though transactions can still abort
  - Goal: serializability and minimal impact of aborts

Lock-based protocols
- transactions must acquire locks
    - share locks
    - exclusive locks
- lock requess are made to the concurrency control manager
    - it decides whether to grant a lock request

2-phase Locking Protocol
 - phase 1: growing phase
    - transaction may obtain locks
    - but may not release them 
 - phase 2: shrinking phase
    - only release locks
 - what about deadlock??
 - 2PL guarantees conflict-serializability
    - lock-point: the time at which a transcation acquired last lock
    - if lock-point(T1) < lock-point(T2), there can't be an edge from T2 to T1 in the precedence graph
 - rigorous 2PL: release both exclusive and read locks only at the very end
    - makes serializablity order == the commit order
    - more intuitive behavior for users 
 - strict 2PL lock conversion
    - transaction might not be sure what it needs a write lock on in advance
    - start with an S lock 
    - upgrade to an X lock later if needed 
    - doesn't change any of the other properties
 - strict and rigorous 2PL ensure consistency but not deadlocks

Dealing with deadlocks
 - deadlock detected, what to do?
    - kill one, usually the youngest in the cycle
 - how to deal with them pre-emptively? 
    - wait-die scheme
    - wound-wait scheme
    - both are biased in favor of the older transactions, since they're assumed to have gotten more work done
    - but, that means the possibility of starvation
        - if a young transaction is aborted too many times, it may be given priority in continuing

Locking granularity 
 - coarse vs fine - tradeoffs!
