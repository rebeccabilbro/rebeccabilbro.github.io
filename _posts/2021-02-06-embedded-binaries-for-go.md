Recently a friend asked about Go packages for embedding binary data into code...
As it turns out, there are a lot of options!

# go-bindata

## [go-bindata/go-bindata](https://github.com/go-bindata/go-bindata)
This package converts any file into Go source code, including for embedding binary data into a Go program. The file data is optionally gzip compressed before being converted to a raw byte slice. It comes with a command line tool in the `go-bindata` sub directory. The converted file(s) is/are embedded in a new Go source file, along with a table of contents and an `Asset` function, which allows quick access to the asset, based on its name.

## [kevinburke/go-bindata](https://github.com/kevinburke/go-bindata)
As of the time of this writing, the most recenting updated fork of the original `go-bindata/go-bindata`. This fork is also apparently the version trusted by Homebrew. Changes from the original package include:
- Atomic writes; generated file cannot be read while partially complete.
- Better encoding of files that contain characters in the Unicode format range.
- Generated file reports file sizes.
- Generated code is run through go fmt.
- SHA256 hashes are computed for all files and stored in the binary. You can use this to detect in-memory corruption and to provide easy cache-busting mechanisms.
- Added AssetString and MustAssetString functions.
- ByName is not public.
- Some errors in file writes were unchecked, but are now checked.
- File modes are stored in octal (0644) instead of nonsensical decimal (420)

# [pkger](https://github.com/markbates/pkger)
`pkger` is a tool for embedding static files into Go binaries and was intended as a replacement for [gobuffalo/packr](https://github.com/gobuffalo/packr)). Use the `pkger` command to package files and the `parser` tool to access them after packaging. The API is modeled on the `os` package in the Go standard lib.

# [esc](https://github.com/mjibson/esc/)
`esc` embeds files into Go programs and provides http.FileSystem interfaces to them. It adds all named files or files recursively under named directories at the path specified. The output file provides an http.FileSystem interface with zero dependencies on packages outside the standard library. After producing an output file, the assets may be accessed with the FS() function.
