The Resource Description Framework, or RDF, is a standard model for data interchange that allows structured and semi-structured data to be shared across different applications. RDF expresses relationships between entities as triples; essentially a graph that links unique URIs via edges that describe their relationships. In this post, we'll use the Python library `rdflib` to build a graph from RDF data about products and to extract information about individual products.

## About the Data
The data used in this post can be found [here](http://data.dws.informatik.uni-mannheim.de/structureddata/2014-12/quads/ClassSpecificQuads/schemaorgProduct.nq.sample.txt). It comes from the [Web Data Commons project](http://www.webdatacommons.org/structureddata/2014-12/stats/schema_org_subsets.html), which extracts structured data describing products, people, organizations, places, and events from the Web and make the extracted data available for download. In particular, we will be exploring the subset of the corpus that concerns products and product descriptions.


```python
import os
import requests

base_folder = "data"
products_url = "http://data.dws.informatik.uni-mannheim.de/structureddata/2014-12/quads/ClassSpecificQuads/schemaorgProduct.nq.sample.txt"
product_path = "products.nq"


def download_data(dir_path, data_url, data_path):
    """
    Convenience function that uses the requests library to retrieve data
    given a url to the dataset and a directory folder on your computer.
    """
    if not os.path.exists(dir_path):
        os.mkdir(dir_path)

    response = requests.get(data_url)
    with open(os.path.join(dir_path, data_path), "wb") as f:
        f.write(response.content)

    return data_path

download_data(base_folder, products_url, product_path)
```


### What is RDF?

The product data we'll be exploring is represented in RDF (Resource Description Framework) format. RDF is a directed, labeled graph data format for representing information in the Web. Resources are represented as nodes in the graph and identified by unique URIs. Edges represent the named link between two given resources.

### What are N-Quads?

RDF is an abstract model with several serialization formats that have different encodings. The variant we'll be dealing with is called N-Quad. N-Quads is a line-based, plain text format for encoding an RDF dataset. In the data we'll be looking at, the forth element of each line contains the URL of the webpage from which the data was extracted.

Let's take a look at the first couple lines of the raw file:


```python
with open(os.path.join(base_folder, product_path), "rb") as input_data:
    for i in range(5):
        print(input_data.readline())
        print("")
```

    b'_:nodee130f8cb43e689a9fee53a44337 <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#type> <http://schema.org/Offer> <http://24h.pchome.com.tw/prod/DGBO6L-A72119703> .\n'

    b'_:nodedce6998dc1a66ec67558dfb368cc3e3 <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#type> <http://schema.org/Product> <http://24h.pchome.com.tw/prod/DGBO6L-A72119703> .\n'

    b'_:nodedce6998dc1a66ec67558dfb368cc3e3 <http://schema.org/Product/offers> _:nodee130f8cb43e689a9fee53a44337 <http://24h.pchome.com.tw/prod/DGBO6L-A72119703> .\n'

    b'_:noded8ceb1a23d14863c1ee9bf9ea0ac4b90 <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#type> <http://schema.org/Product> <http://800ceoread.com/products/big-wave-surfing-kenneth-j-thurber-english> .\n'

    b'_:noded8ceb1a23d14863c1ee9bf9ea0ac4b90 <http://schema.org/Product/name> "\\n          \\n          Big Wave Surfing: Extreme Technology Development, Management, Marketing & Investing\\n        "@en <http://800ceoread.com/products/big-wave-surfing-kenneth-j-thurber-english> .\n'



To unpack the first line from above a bit, the first part, `b'_:node`, tells us that this is an anonymous resource or [blank node](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blank_node) (one that doesn't have a URI). The subsequent string of characters, `e130f8cb43e689a9fee53a44337` is an identifier for the subject that has been assigned the blank node to disambiguate it from others. The next part, `<http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#type>` specifies the namespace. Next, `<http://schema.org/Offer>` expresses that the relationship between the subject and object is that the subject is an `offerFor` the object, whose URI is `<http://24h.pchome.com.tw/prod/DGBO6L-A72119703>`.

### Using `rdflib`

In Python, we can use the `rdflib` library (which you can install via `pip`) to build a graph structure from the product data we've downloaded:


```python
from rdflib import ConjunctiveGraph

def make_graph_from_nquads(input_data):
    g = ConjunctiveGraph(identifier="Products")
    data = open(input_data, "rb")
    g.parse(data, format="nquads")

    return g

g = make_graph_from_nquads(os.path.join(base_folder, product_path))
```

The result is a [`ConjunctiveGraph`](http://rdflib.readthedocs.io/en/3.4.0/modules/graphs/conjunctive_graph.html), an aggregation of all the named graphs that can be extracted from our sample RDF document, whose length (`len(g)`) is equal to the number of nodes in the graph (in our case, 4983).

Now let's take a look at what's in our graph. We can traverse the graph using the `graph.quads()` method, which returns a generator. We can explore just first few like this:

```python
for quad in g.quads():
    print(quad)
    print("")
```

    (rdflib.term.BNode('N413e6a4d0e7b4e53adb8ba2d288468d9'), rdflib.term.URIRef('http://schema.org/Review/datePublished'), rdflib.term.Literal('Dec, 2007', lang='en-us'), <Graph identifier=http://alatest.com/reviews/fridge-freezer-reviews/gold-gi15nfrtb-15-built-in-ice-maker-with-25-lbs-capacity-storage-bin-50-lbs-daily-pro/po3-67344689,336/ (<class 'rdflib.graph.Graph'>)>)

    (rdflib.term.BNode('Nf889a186374e4da8969f01e0834ba03a'), rdflib.term.URIRef('http://schema.org/Review/description'), rdflib.term.Literal('Overall, I am very pleased with this Netbook. The keyboard is just big enough to type comfortably on. I am able to stream Netflix, Hulu, and YouTube content with no problem. I was not able to watch over the air HD television with my Pinnacle HDTV USB...', lang='en-us'), <Graph identifier=http://alatest.com/reviews/netbook-mini-laptop/asus-epc1000he-blk005x/po3-180190577,354/ (<class 'rdflib.graph.Graph'>)>)

    ...

Let's break down an example nquad, a small graph of an anonymous resource (`'N6ac59173268e46b3b3307d84785d8416'`), which expresses a keyword relationship (`'http://schema.org/ImageObject/keywords'`) between the word 'brainstorming' and a stock photo:

![brainstorming_photo](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rebeccabilbro/rebeccabilbro.github.io/master/images/2018-07-02-brainstorming-stock-photo.jpg)

(from [Deposit Photos](http://dep.ph/v/3slyo5))

Suppose we wanted to search our graph to see if the photo has any other keywords? We can do so using the classes `BNode` and `URIRef`. A `BNode` is an anonymous or blank node, and a `URIRef` is a URI reference within the RDF graph.


```python
from rdflib import BNode, URIRef

target_node = BNode('N6ac59173268e46b3b3307d84785d8416')
keyword_ref = URIRef('http://schema.org/ImageObject/keywords')

keywords = [
    str(keyword) for bnode, linkage, keyword, product_uri
    in g.quads((target_node, keyword_ref, None, None))
]

print(list(keywords))
```

    ['paperwork', 'brainstorm', 'laptop', 'stylish', 'people', 'technology',
    'male', 'colleagues', 'partnership', 'documents', 'businessman',
    'workplace', 'office', 'desk', 'showing', 'diary', 'adult', 'coworkers',
    'well', 'shirt', 'strategy', 'working', 'together', 'team', 'corporate',
    'caucasian', '20s', 'indoors', 'wireless', 'partners', 'young', '40s',
    'computer', 'elegant', 'smart', 'explaining', 'teamwork', 'business',
    'brainstorming', 'classy', 'dressed', 'pointing', 'communication',
    'interaction', 'mature', 'sophisticated', 'meeting', 'man', 'bureau',
    'staff']


Similarly, we might traverse through quads to find only those that have images associated with them:


```python
image_ref = URIRef("http://schema.org/Product/image")

images = [
    image for bnode, linkage, image, product_uri
    in g.quads((None, image_ref, None, None))
]
```


### Find the Products

As we can see, there are a lot of things in the graph that are related to products but aren't actually products themselves, such as keywords, images, reviews, and offers (advertisements). So how can we find all of the products in the graph?

We can use the `graph.subjects()` method to traverse all the unique nodes of the graph to find ones that correspond to subjects, and we can further constrain the search by specifying the subset of subjects whose objects have the URIRef for products (`"http://schema.org/Product"`).


```python
from rdflib import URIRef

# get all the unique products
product_list = list(set(g.subjects(object=URIRef("http://schema.org/Product"))))
```

This leaves us with 216 unique products.

Now imagine that we'd like to index these products as documents in a document store like MongoDB or Elasticsearch, which would enable search in the context of (for instance) an application.

To do this, we'll convert our graph into a dictionary representation, so that each product is represented as a key and the values correspond to the product details contained in the graph. First we'll create a mapping between each of the possible product-related URIRefs and the field names to be used in Elasticsearch:

```python
PRODUCT_FIELDS = {"name"    : "http://schema.org/Product/name",
                  "image"   : "http://schema.org/Product/image",
                  "url"     : "http://schema.org/Product/url",
                  "desc"    : "http://schema.org/Product/description",
                  "sku"     : "http://schema.org/Product/sku",
                  "review"  : "http://schema.org/Product/review",
                  "manu"    : "http://schema.org/Product/manufacturer",
                  "reviews" : "http://schema.org/Product/reviews",
                  "prod_id" : "http://schema.org/Product/productID",
                  "mod_date": "http://schema.org/Product/dateModified",
                  "rel_date": "http://schema.org/Product/releaseDate",
                  "brand"   : "http://schema.org/Product/brand",
                  "model"   : "http://schema.org/Product/model",
                  "offers"  : "http://schema.org/Product/offers",
                  "thumb"   : "http://schema.org/Product/thumbnailUrl",
                  "logo"    : "http://schema.org/Product/logo",
                  "rating"  : "http://schema.org/Product/aggregateRating",
    }
```

We'll create a dictionary with keys for each unique product; each value will holds a dictionary with each of the possible product descriptors from the RDF graph.

Next, we'll loop over each unique product id, and for each related quad in the graph (i.e. with a matching product id), and for each possible product URIRef, we'll update the dictionary with the specific details of the linkage relationship for that product.


```python
product_dict = dict()

for product in product_list:
    for bnode, linkage, detail, product_uri in g.quads( (product, None, None, None) ):
        if str(linkage) in PRODUCT_FIELDS.values():
            if bnode not in product_dict.keys():
                product_dict[str(bnode)] = {'bnode':str(bnode)}
                bnode_data = {"name"    : None,
                              "image"   : None,
                              "url"     : None,
                              "desc"    : None,
                              "sku"     : None,
                              "review"  : None,
                              "manu"    : None,
                              "reviews" : None,
                              "prod_id" : None,
                              "mod_date": None,
                              "rel_date": None,
                              "brand"   : None,
                              "model"   : None,
                              "offers"  : None,
                              "thumb"   : None,
                              "logo"    : None,
                              "rating"  : None}
                product_dict[str(bnode)].update(bnode_data)
                for field_type, schema in PRODUCT_FIELDS.items():
                    if str(linkage) == schema:
                        bnode_data[field_type] = str(detail)

                    product_dict[str(bnode)].update(bnode_data)
```

Now we can examine our (admittedly sparse) results!


```python
from pprint import pprint

for key, val in product_dict.items():
    print(key)
    pprint(val)
    break
```

    N4e1bd4624ffe4b93a9bef8164cd139f6
    {'bnode': 'N4e1bd4624ffe4b93a9bef8164cd139f6',
     'brand': None,
     'desc': None,
     'image': None,
     'logo': None,
     'manu': None,
     'mod_date': None,
     'model': None,
     'name': None,
     'offers': None,
     'prod_id': None,
     'rating': None,
     'rel_date': None,
     'review': 'N8717bf6252d64d74acf056ca08fdef2d',
     'reviews': None,
     'sku': None,
     'thumb': None,
     'url': None}

That's all for now!

Next up I'll do a post on using the Python [`SPARQLWrapper`](https://rdflib.github.io/sparqlwrapper/) to query RDF documents using the SPARQL query language. SPARQL can be used to express queries across diverse data sources, whether the data is stored natively as RDF or viewed as RDF via middleware. SPARQL contains capabilities for querying required and optional graph patterns along with their conjunctions and disjunctions. SPARQL also supports extensible value testing and constraining queries by source RDF graph. The results of SPARQL queries can be results sets or RDF graphs.
