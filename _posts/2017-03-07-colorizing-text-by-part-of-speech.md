title:  Colorizing text based on part-of-speech tags

In this post, I'll describe the use case and preliminary implementation of a new [Yellowbrick](http://www.scikit-yb.org) feature that enables the user to print out colorized text that illustrates different parts-of-speech.


## Part-of-speech tagging

Under the hood, the majority of NLP-based applications work in the same fundamental way; they take in text data as input, parse it into composite parts, compute upon those composites, and then recombine them to deliver a meaningful and tailored end result.

To transform a raw text corpus into data that can be used for modeling, there are five things that need to happen first: content extraction, paragraph blocking, sentence segmentation, word tokenization, and part-of-speech tagging. This means that part-of-speech tagging is a critical component in many natural language processing activities.

Once you have broken the documents down in to paragraphs, the paragraphs into sentences, and the sentences into tokens, you need to tag each token with the it's appropriate part of speech.

Parts of speech (e.g. verbs, nouns, prepositions, adjectives) indicate how a word is functioning within the context of a sentence. In English as in many other languages, a single word can function in multiple ways, and we would like to be able to distinguish those uses (for example the words "ship" and "shop" can be either a verb, or a noun, depending on the context). Part-of-speech tagging lets us encode information not only about a word's definition, but also its use in context.

If you're using NLTK, the off-the-shelf part-of-speech tagger, [`pos_tag`](https://github.com/nltk/nltk/blob/develop/nltk/tag/__init__.py), uses the +PerceptronTagger()+ (which you can read more about [here](https://explosion.ai/blog/part-of-speech-pos-tagger-in-python)) and the Penn Treebank tagset (at least it does at the time of this writing).

The [Penn Treebank tagset](https://www.ling.upenn.edu/courses/Fall_2003/ling001/penn_treebank_pos.html) consists of 36 parts of speech, structural tags, and indicators of tense (+NN+ for singular nouns, +NNS+ for plural nouns, +JJ+ for adjectives, +RB+ for adverbs, +PRP+ for personal pronouns, etc.).

## Hiccups

So I am working on a project at work that involves extracting keyphrases from unstructured text data, using an approach that is inspired by Burton DeWilde's [excellent post](http://bdewilde.github.io/blog/2014/09/23/intro-to-automatic-keyphrase-extraction/) on the topic. As he explains:

> A brute-force method might consider all words and/or phrases in a document as candidate keyphrases. However, given computational costs and the fact that not all words and phrases in a document are equally likely to convey its content, heuristics are typically used to identify a smaller subset of better candidates. Common heuristics include removing stop words and punctuation; filtering for words with certain parts of speech or, for multi-word phrases, certain POS patterns; and using external knowledge bases like WordNet or Wikipedia as a reference source of good/bad keyphrases.

> For example, rather than taking all of the n-grams... we might limit ourselves to only noun phrases matching the POS pattern... that matches any number of adjectives followed by at least one noun that may be joined by a preposition to one other adjective(s)+noun(s) sequence...

This brute force strategy actually works quite well with grammatical English text. But what if the text you are dealing with is not grammatical, or is rife with spelling and punctuation errors?  In these cases, your part-of-speech tagger could be completely failing to tag important tokens!

Or what if the text you are using does not encode the meaningful keyphrases according to the adjective-noun pattern? For example, there are numerous cases where the salient information could be captured not in the adjective phrases but instead in verbal or adverbial phrases, or in the proper nouns (as with named entity recognition). In this case, while your part-of-speech tagger may be working properly, if your keyphrase chunker looks something like...

```python
grammar=r'KT: {(<JJ>* <NN.*>+ <IN>)? <JJ>* <NN.*>+}'
chunker = nltk.chunk.regexp.RegexpParser(grammar)
```

...you might indeed fail to capture the most critical verbal, adverbial, and entity phrases from your corpus!

Encountering these types of problems led me to think that it would be helpful to be able to visually explore the parts-of-speech in a text before proceeding on to normalization, vectorization, and modeling (or perhaps as a diagnostic tool for understanding disappointing modeling results). Discovering that a large percentage of your text is not being labeled (or is being mislabeled) by your part-of-speech tagger might lead you to train your own regular expression based tagger using your particular corpus. Alternatively, it might impact the way in which you chose to normalize your text (e.g. if there were many meaningful variations in the ways a certain root word was appearing, it might lead you to choose lemmatization over stemming, in spite of the increased computation time).


## Existing tools

At first, I looked around to see if there was already something implemented that I could just `pip install` like a boss and move along. I didn't find anything that was quite what I was looking for, though I did find a few interesting leads:

- ["Add Colour to Text in Python" by Mark Williams](http://ozzmaker.com/add-colour-to-text-in-python/)
- [Colorama](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/colorama), a cross-platform colored terminal text package on PyPI
- [Clint](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/clint/), a module with tools for developing command line applications (including colored text).
- [Stackoverflow question: "Print in terminal with colors using Python?"](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/287871/print-in-terminal-with-colors-using-python)
- [Termcolor](https://github.com/Parallel-in-Time/PararealF90/tree/master/termcolor-1.1.0), a little utility for ANSI color formatting for terminal output

One challenge that all of these resources address is the problem of dealing with ANSI colors, which can feel a bit limiting when you are spoiled by things like [colorbrewer](http://colorbrewer2.org/#type=sequential&scheme=BuGn&n=3) and the already-implemented-in-Python [Matplotlib colormaps](http://matplotlib.org/users/colormaps.html) and [Yellowbrick palettes](http://www.scikit-yb.org/en/latest/examples/palettes.html). There are either 8 or 16 ANSI colors, depending on whether you count the "normal" and "bright" intensity variants. The colors are black, red, green, yellow, blue, magenta, cyan, and white.

However, the issue is that for the most part, all the resources I found treat colorization as akin to flipping a switch on or off using ANSI escape sequences. This works okay if the goal is to colorize blocks of text or other terminal output; the challenge is in adapting the switches for the within-sentence-level token colorization that is needed to illustrate parts-of-speech in a visual fashion.


## The components of a part-of-speech colorizer

The goal is to enable visual part-of-speech tagging. In particular, I envisioned the `PosTagVisualizer()` as a simple utility that would let Yellowbrick users visualize the proportions of nouns, verbs, etc. and to use this information to make decisions about part-of-speech tagging, text normalization (e.g. stemming vs lemmatization), vectorization, and modeling.

We'll need three main things:
 1. A dictionary that will map human-interpretable color names to ANSI formatted color codes.
 2. A dictionary that will map human-interpretable color names to the Penn Treebank tag set.
 3. A function that will connect (1) and (2) within a sentence that has already been tokenized and tagged.


### Building a ANSI colormap

In order to build the ANSI colormap, I had to make some decisions about how much hard-coding to do in advance. One option is to [reference the ANSI colors by their numeric codes](https://github.com/tartley/colorama/blob/master/colorama/ansi.py#L49), which basically correspond to the whole numbers between 30 and 39.  If we do this, we will later need to prepend and append the appropriate escape sequences (e.g. the `\033[0;` or `\033[1;` prefix depending on color intensity, and `\033[0m` for the suffix). These codes need to wrap the specific text we mean to colorize. For instance

```python
print("\033[0;31mi love chili peppers\033[0m")
```

... should print out

<span style="color:red;">i love chili peppers</span>

Ultimately, I decided to use Python string formatting brackets and hard code the rest into my colormap.

```python
COLORS = {
    'white'      : "\033[0;37m{}\033[0m",
    'yellow'     : "\033[0;33m{}\033[0m",
    'green'      : "\033[0;32m{}\033[0m",
    'blue'       : "\033[0;34m{}\033[0m",
    'cyan'       : "\033[0;36m{}\033[0m",
    'red'        : "\033[0;31m{}\033[0m",
    'magenta'    : "\033[0;35m{}\033[0m",
    'black'      : "\033[0;30m{}\033[0m",
    'darkwhite'  : "\033[1;37m{}\033[0m",
    'darkyellow' : "\033[1;33m{}\033[0m",
    'darkgreen'  : "\033[1;32m{}\033[0m",
    'darkblue'   : "\033[1;34m{}\033[0m",
    'darkcyan'   : "\033[1;36m{}\033[0m",
    'darkred'    : "\033[1;31m{}\033[0m",
    'darkmagenta': "\033[1;35m{}\033[0m",
    'darkblack'  : "\033[1;30m{}\033[0m",
    'off'        : "\033[0;0m{}\033[0m"
}
```

### Mapping the colors to Penn Treebank tags

The next step is to map the colors to the Penn Treebank tags. This was challenging mainly because there are a LOT of part-of-speech tags, and basically only 8 colors. If I was going to do this again, I might extend my options by using not only text colorization (e.g. foreground text coloring) but also text highlighting (e.g. background text coloring), just to give myself some more options for the colorization. What I've done for now is to group similar tags into color categories, so any kind of noun is green, whether it's singular, plural, proper, or otherwise:

```python
tag_map = {
    'NN'   : 'green',
    'NNS'  : 'green',
    'NNP'  : 'green',
    'NNPS' : 'green',
    'VB'   : 'blue',
    'VBD'  : 'blue',
    'VBG'  : 'blue',
    'VBN'  : 'blue',
    'VBP'  : 'blue',
    'VBZ'  : 'blue',
    'JJ'   : 'red',
    'JJR'  : 'red',
    'JJS'  : 'red',
    'RB'   : 'cyan',
    'RBR'  : 'cyan',
    'RBS'  : 'cyan',
    'IN'   : 'darkwhite',
    'POS'  : 'darkyellow',
    'PRP$' : 'magenta',
    'PRP$' : 'magenta',
    'DT'   : 'black',
    'CC'   : 'black',
    'CD'   : 'black',
    'WDT'  : 'black',
    'WP'   : 'black',
    'WP$'  : 'black',
    'WRB'  : 'black',
    'EX'   : 'yellow',
    'FW'   : 'yellow',
    'LS'   : 'yellow',
    'MD'   : 'yellow',
    'PDT'  : 'yellow',
    'RP'   : 'yellow',
    'SYM'  : 'yellow',
    'TO'   : 'yellow',
}
```

Ultimately, this mapping could use some tuning, but in practice it was good enough to be able to visually detect some different parts of speech, so I proceeded.

### A function to colorize the text

Now we need a way to retrieve the appropriate color code from our colormap and substitute in our token text into the string that the function returns:

```python
def colored(text, color=None):
    """
    Colorize text
    """
    if os.getenv('ANSI_COLORS_DISABLED') is None:
        if color is not None:
            text = COLORS[color].format(text)
    return text
```

Nothing too fancy here, but it works.

### Now in the if-main statement

One of the decisions I made early on was that none of my package functions should perform any kind of tokenization or tagging. My reason for this was simple; the purpose of the package is not to actually perform the tokenization and part-of-speech tagging, it's to visually evaluate the results of tokenization and pos-tagging. Also, since I ultimately wanted to be able to integrate this as a utility into Yellowbrick, I wanted to make sure that I would give as much control over things like data wrangling, normalization, standardization, vectorization, etc. over to the user as possible, which is pretty consistent with the API that we've conceived for the project. This will prevent us from having to add something like NLTK as a dependency for Yellowbrick.

For this reason, the word tokenization and part-of-speech tagging for my text happen inside the if-main statement, as do the requisite import statements:

```python

import os
from nltk.corpus import wordnet as wn
from nltk import pos_tag, word_tokenize

text = """In a small saucepan, combine sugar
          and eggs until well blended. Cook
          over low heat, stirring constantly,
          until mixture reaches 160° and coats
          the back of a metal spoon. Remove
          from the heat. Stir in chocolate and
          vanilla until smooth. Cool to
          lukewarm (90°), stirring occasionally.
          In a small bowl, cream butter until
          light and fluffy. Add cooled
          chocolate mixture; beat on high speed
          for 5 minutes or until light and
          fluffy. In another large bowl, beat
          cream until it begins to thicken. Add
          confectioners' sugar; beat until stiff
          peaks form. Fold into chocolate
          mixture. Pour into crust. Chill for at
          least 6 hours before serving. Garnish
          with whipped cream and chocolate curls
          if desired."""

# Tokenize the text
tokens = word_tokenize(text)

# Part of speech tag the text and map to Treebank-tagged colors
tagged = [
  (tag_map.get(tag),token)
  for token, tag in pos_tag(tokens)
]
print(' '.join(
  (colored(token, color)
  for color, token in tagged)))
```

Here's the result when I run that in my terminal:

![french silk pie in the terminal](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rebeccabilbro/rebeccabilbro.github.io/master/images/2017-03-07-terminal-french-silk.png)

It works! My next question was whether I could get it to work in a Jupyter Notebook, since the user tests and tutorials we're adding to the Yellowbrick [examples directory](https://github.com/DistrictDataLabs/yellowbrick/tree/develop/examples) are in the form of `.ipynb` files.

Here's what it looks like when I run the code in a Jupyter notebook:

Now, just for comparison's sake, here's what a few other texts look like:

```python
algebra = '''Algebra (from Arabic "al-jabr" meaning
             "reunion of broken parts") is one of the
             broad parts of mathematics, together with
             number theory, geometry and analysis. In
             its most general form, algebra is the study
             of mathematical symbols and the rules for
             manipulating these symbols; it is a unifying
             thread of almost all of mathematics.'''
```

```python
nursery_rhyme = '''Baa, baa, black sheep,
                   Have you any wool?
                   Yes, sir, yes, sir,
                   Three bags full;
                   One for the master,
                   And one for the dame,
                   And one for the little boy
                   Who lives down the lane.'''
```

Cool!

### Conforming to the Yellowbrick API

Okay, so the next step is tricky. We need to decide what the best way is to integrate these little standalone functions into a class, and in particular, one that will conform to the existing Yellowbrick API, which has pre-defined methods like `fit()`, `score()`, `draw()`, `transform()`, `finalize()`, and `poof()`, depending on what type of Visualizer you have.

I was pretty sure that I wanted to subclass the `TextVisualizer` object, mainly because I imagined that the [`yellowbrick.text` module](https://github.com/DistrictDataLabs/yellowbrick/tree/develop/yellowbrick/text) would be the most natural place for people to look for visualization tools related to text data.

```python
from yellowbrick.text.base import TextVisualizer

class PosTagVisualizer(TextVisualizer):
    """
    A part-of-speech tag visualizer colorizes text to enable
    the user to visualize the proportions of nouns, verbs, etc.
    and to use this information to make decisions about token tagging,
    text normalization (e.g. stemming vs lemmatization),
    vectorization, and modeling.

        print('\n')

```

The main decision I had to make was the one to not implement a `poof()` method for the `PosTagVisualizer`. Under the hood, `poof()` calls `finalize()`, an internal method that creates a matplotlib plot object if the plot has not already been created. I decided that it would look weird to have an empty plot tacked on, so I made `transform()` do the bulk of the work in calling the `colorize()` method.  

## Conclusion
So, this works ok in the console and in a _live_ Jupyter Notebook. I noticed that when I saved it as an [.ipynb file](https://github.com/DistrictDataLabs/yellowbrick/blob/develop/examples/rebeccabilbro/postag.ipynb) and pushed to GitHub, it converted all the text to black and I lost the colorization. There are definitely something that I'd like to go back to tweak eventually.
