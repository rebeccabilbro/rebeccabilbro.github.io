    "\n",
    "The Resource Description Framework or RDF is a standard model for data interchange that allows structured and semi-structured data to be shared across different applications. RDF expresses relationships between entities as triples; essentially a graph that links unique URIs via edges that describe their relationship. In this post, we'll use the Python library `rdflib` to build a product data graph and extract information about those individual products.\n",

    "## About the Data\n",
    "The data used in this post can be found [here](http://data.dws.informatik.uni-mannheim.de/structureddata/2014-12/quads/ClassSpecificQuads/schemaorgProduct.nq.sample.txt). It comes from the [Web Data Commons project](http://www.webdatacommons.org/structureddata/2014-12/stats/schema_org_subsets.html), which extracts structured data describing products, people, organizations, places, and events from billions of web pages and make the extracted data available for download. In particular, we will be exploring the subset of the corpus that concerns products and product descriptions. "
