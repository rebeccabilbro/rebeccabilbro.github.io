    "# Introduction to Document Similarity with Elasticsearch\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Document Distance\n",
    "Short intro to document similarity - finding a way to represent the distance between documents. \n",
    "\n",
    "Two things needed:\n",
    " - The first is to encode the documents as vectors. There are options for this (one-hot, frequency, distributed). \n",
    " - The second is to decide how to measure distance - Euclidean? Manhattan? Cosine? There are tradeoffs but cosine is a good place to start with text. Why? Documents encoded as vectors are sparse; each vector could be as long as the number of unique words across the full corpus.  That means that two documents of very different lengths (e.g. a single recipe and a cookbook), could be encoded with the same length vector, which might overemphasize the magnitude of the book's document vector at the expense of the recipe's document vector. Cosine distance helps to correct for variations in vector magnitudes resulting from uneven length documents, and enables us to measure the distance between the book and recipe.\n",
    " \n",
    "Document similarity is something we cover in the book - in chapter 6 and then in chapter 10 where we build a chatbot that, among other things, uses a nearest neigbor search to recommend recipes that are similar to the ingredients listed by the user. One of my observations during the prototyping phase for that chapter is how slow vanilla nearest neighbor search is. This led me to think about different ways to optimize the search, from using variations like k-ball, to using other Python libraries like Spotify's Annoy, and also to other kind of tools altogether that attempt to deliver a similar results as quickly as possible. Like ElasticSearch!\n",

      "\t   Smoothies are one of our favorite breakfast options year-round, but especially in the winter because it's an easy way to brighten the mornings by adding extra fruit to our diets. And since frozen fruit works just as well (if not better â€” hello, icy, creamy texture), there's no worry about whether it's in season.\n",

      "\t         Sometimes, you just have to go with a classic. This smoothie recipe is one of our standbys. We might dress it up or down with a touch of mint or swap in coconut water, but we can always count on it to be delicious.\n",

      "\t        Adding mint to your smoothie is a total pro move. Not only does it amplify the fresh taste, but it also makes it feel slightly more like dessert than a healthy breakfast. This smoothie also has a pinch of sea salt to boost all the other flavors.\n",
