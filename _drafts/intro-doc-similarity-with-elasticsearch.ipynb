    "# Introduction to Document Similarity with Elasticsearch\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Document Distance\n",
    "Short intro to document similarity - finding a way to represent the distance between documents. \n",
    "\n",
    "Two things needed:\n",
    " - The first is to encode the documents as vectors. There are options for this (one-hot, frequency, distributed). \n",
    " - The second is to decide how to measure distance - Euclidean? Manhattan? Cosine? There are tradeoffs but cosine is a good place to start with text. Why? Documents encoded as vectors are sparse; each vector could be as long as the number of unique words across the full corpus.  That means that two documents of very different lengths (e.g. a single recipe and a cookbook), could be encoded with the same length vector, which might overemphasize the magnitude of the book's document vector at the expense of the recipe's document vector. Cosine distance helps to correct for variations in vector magnitudes resulting from uneven length documents, and enables us to measure the distance between the book and recipe.\n",
    " \n",
    "Document similarity is something we cover in the book - in chapter 6 and then in chapter 10 where we build a chatbot that, among other things, uses a nearest neigbor search to recommend recipes that are similar to the ingredients listed by the user. One of my observations during the prototyping phase for that chapter is how slow vanilla nearest neighbor search is. This led me to think about different ways to optimize the search, from using variations like k-ball, to using other Python libraries like Spotify's Annoy, and also to other kind of tools altogether that attempt to deliver a similar results as quickly as possible. Like ElasticSearch!\n",

    "The Yellowbrick machine learning visualization library hosts several datasets wrangled from the UCI Machine Learning Repository or built by District Data Labs to present the examples used throughout this documentation, one of which is a text corpus of news documents collected from different domain area RSS feeds.

It’s unfancy food at its best, as should be no surprise from the woman who was very distressed by complicated chefs’ recipes, wondering \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSo when I first saw Food & Wine’s Cacio e Pepe Pasta Pie on Pinterest earlier this month, as one does, my first thought was “Oooh, so impossible-to-achieve outside a food styling studio pretty,” (because, I mean, look at it) followed by “Wait, that’s not cacio e pepe” (a Roman dish with exactly three ingredients — pecorino, black pepper and spaghetti, usually fresh tonnarelli, and if you can forgive me for being pedantic, definitely no cheddar), followed by “Wouldn’t all of that egg custard leak from my springform?” (answer: yes, and woe is my oven floor) and then “I wonder what Marcella Hazan would have thought of this.” Would she have been distraught by the springform, perturbed by the use of three types of cheese, shaking her head over the finish under the broiler?\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nWell, if she’s anything like the rest of us, I think she’d be too busy enjoying it to ask such questions because this dish — which I’d liken to the halfway point between a spaghetti frittata and a spaghetti quiche — is spectacular. I made it on a whim a couple weeks ago (because that’s my thing these days) and even though my peeling wood-veneer kitchen counter is the furthest cry from a photography studio, it was a total stunner. And while this is unequivocally comfort food — pasta, eggs, and a glorious amount of cheese, yesss — something about eating it in tall wedges with a green salad felt almost civilized, humble food raised to its most centerpiece-worthy calling, and all from just a handful of ingredients. We’re going to be making this a lot this winter, I can tell.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nOne year ago: Caramelized Onion and Gruyere Biscuits\\nTwo years ago: Homemade Dulce de Leche\\nThree years ago: Intensely Chocolate Sables\\nFour years ago: Potato Chip Cookies\\nFive years ago: Roast Chicken with Dijon Sauce\\nSix years ago: Black Bean Soup with Toasted Cumin Seed Crema + Cranberry Syrup and an Intensely Almond Cake\\nSeven years ago: Mushroom Bourguignon and Sugar Puffs\\nEight years ago: Leek and Swiss Chard Tart\\nNine years ago: Grapefruit Yogurt Cake and Pasta with Sausage Tomatoes and Mushrooms\\n\\nAnd for the other side of the world:\\nSix Months Ago: Tomato and Fried Provolone Sandwich\\n1.5 Years Ago: Bourbon Slush Punch\\n2.5 Years Ago: Mama Canales-Garcia’s Avocado Shrimp Salsa\\n3.5 Years Ago: Zucchini Bread Pancakes\\n4.5 Years Ago: Corn, Buttermilk and Chive Popovers\\n\\n\\nSpaghetti Pie with Pecorino and Black Pepper\\nAdapted from Justin Chapple at Food & Wine\\n\\nThis pie plays off the flavors of classic cacio e pepe — these flavors will be, delightfully, the strongest — but, of course, I fiddled with it a little. The first time, I made it with 8 ounces each of pecorino romano and fontina (because although I love cheddar, I just couldn’t). The second time, I made with less of each (which was a mistake) and because I’ve become That Person, the kind of person that needs to see some green before I can allow something to become a regular meal, I added about a cup of blanched and finely chopped broccoli rabe (which was not). That said, while we enjoyed our green-flecked spaghetti wedges, we agreed we’d have liked it just as much with the greens on the side, preferably in a garlicky and pepper flake sauteed heap. \\n\\nA few important cooking notes: You must wrap your springform tightly in foil or you and your oven floor will end up in a very bad mood. Please (I beg here) cook your pasta until it’s a good two minutes from done as it will continue cooking in the oven and mushy pasta makes me sad. The greens here are optional (see above) but keep in mind that if you add them, you’ll want to do your best to remove every extra drop of moisture and anticipate that it will take longer to set. Finally, to me, good aged pecorino (usually sold with a black rind) makes all the difference here in providing a salty, funky kick. You can use parmesan if it’s all you’ve got, but you might find that you need more salt if you do.\\n\\u2003\\nButter for greasing springform\\n1/2 pound broccoli rabe, toughest stems saved for another use, chopped into few-inch segments (optional)\\n1 pound dried spaghetti\\n1 1/2 cups milk\\n3 large eggs, lightly beaten\\n2 to 3 teaspoons ground black pepper\\n2 teaspoons coarse or kosher salt\\n8 ounces aged pecorino cheese, finely grated, divided\\n8 ounces fontina cheese, grated, divided\\n\\nHeat oven to 425 degrees. Butter a 9-inch springform pan and this is very important, wrap the outside of the springform, focusing on the places where the ring meets the base, tightly in aluminum foil. Set aside.\\n\\nBring a large pot of well-salted water to a boil. If using broccoli rabe, add it to the pot and boil for 1 to 2 minutes, until it has some give. Fish it out with a large slotted spoon and drain it well. Set aside.\\n\\nAdd spaghetti to boiling water and cook until (this is also important) 2 minutes shy of done, so very al dente, as the spaghetti will continue cooking in the oven. Drain well and let cool slightly.\\n\\nIf using broccoli rabe, wring all extra moisture out of it and blot greens on paper towels to be extra careful. Mince rabe into very small bits. You’ll have about 1 cup total.\\n\\nIn a large bowl, whisk eggs and milk together with salt and pepper. Stir in all but 1/2 cup of each cheese and chopped rabe, if using. Add spaghetti and toss to coat. \\n\\nPour into prepared springform and sprinkle remaining cheese on top. Bake for 35 to 40 minutes (without greens) and up to 15 minutes more (with greens, as they add moisture too), until the cheese is melted and bubbling and a knife inserted into the center of the pie and turned slightly will not release any loose egg batter into the center. If the top of your pie browns too quickly before the center is set, cover it with foil for the remaining cooking time.\\n\\nTurn on your oven’s broiler. Broil the pie a few inches from the heat for 2 to 3 minutes, until browned on top. Cut along springform ring to loosen, then remove ring. Run a spatula underneath the pie to loosen the base and slide onto a serving plate. Cut into wedges.\\n\\nSee more: Casserole, Italian, Pasta, Photo, Vegetarian, Winter \\n\\nDo more: Link | Bookmark \\n | Pin | Print\\n | Email\\n | 136 Comments\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAD\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\xa0\\n\\t\\t\\tJanuary 26, 2016\\n1\\nCan this be made in a cast iron skillet, or does it require a springform pan?\\n\\n\\n1\\n\\nCan this be made in a cast iron skillet, or does it require a springform pan?\\n\\n\\ndeb\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\xa0\\n\\t\\t\\tJanuary 26, 2016\\n2\\nAD — I suspect it would be just fine in a cast-iron skillet, but you might be safest going to a 10-inch as they can be less tall than springforms.\\n\\n\\n2\\n\\nAD — I suspect it would be just fine in a cast-iron skillet, but you might be safest going to a 10-inch as they can be less tall than springforms.\\n\\n\\nAllie\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\xa0\\n\\t\\t\\tJanuary 26, 2016\\n3\\nIf I were able to get around my city (DC) without careening into huge snow banks today, I’d rush out and get these ingredients right now… it’s stunning! \\nAlso, just a little sidebar speaking of Marcella Hazan… have you ever tried her smothered cabbage or smothered cabbage and rice soup?

A tip for the leaky springform pan is to cut a slightly bigger round of parchment paper and lock the springform pan over it so that it acts like a washer in a faucet, but you must use one with the outer lip as shown in the photos above. Only a bead of cheese sauce will ooze out. I am afraid Martha Stewart’s latest cheesecake pan only at Macy’s  is the easiest solution. With a  normal springform pan the leakage can seep under the cavity under the overturned bottom (so there is no lip to catch the product after baking) filling it up. In any case always use a parchment round in the upside down bottom of a cheesecase pan—you can then just slide off the finished result.\\n\\n\\n31\\n\\nThis is called a “timballo”, similar to Food and Wine, May 2015, Justin Chapple: Cacio e Pepe Pasta Pie (yes, it has white cheddar and fontina besides the pecorino, but it works, this is quite different from the classic cacio e pepe pasta).

I still make this once or twice a winter, and my guests are always freaked out when they see the slice with the red sauce peeking through.  The tomato also adds a bit of acid to the taste profile and gives a little bit of a “punch” in flavor.\\n\\n\\n43\\n\\nI make a version that goes way back to the original Silver Palate cook book, described as a fritatta.

IF I were to add veggies, I’d use chives, leeks and green onions – yes, the green tops, too! – and yellow onions, in respectively smaller portions relative to the amount of spaghetti used.  As the guy who “revolutionized the concept of stuffed cabbage by baking it in a Bundt pan” – surely you’ve heard?  ;0) – I like the angel food cake pan option, and believe that a nice coat of olive oil would ensure its releasing the pie intact; same would seem to work with a Calphalon pan, too, but watch the rivets!  Consider cooking the spaghetti in a chicken or beef broth, and reduce the sale accordingly, to complement the onions’ flavor.  And, if you’re lucky enough to find a wheel of marked-down Manchego – roughly akin to a capricious Swiss – sub that for the pecorino a/o fontina.  Don’t be shy with the pepper[s], and make sure you used good fresh ones; consider black and white, but not the off-tasting pink.

Consider cooking the spaghetti in a chicken or beef broth, and reduce the sale accordingly, to complement the onions’ flavor.  And, if you’re lucky enough to find a wheel of marked-down Manchego – roughly akin to a capricious Swiss – sub that for the pecorino a/o fontina.  Don’t be shy with the pepper[s], and make sure you used good fresh ones; consider black and white, but not the off-tasting pink.  Buon appetito!\\n\\n\\nMike\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\xa0\\n\\t\\t\\tJanuary 27, 2016\\n81\\nThanks, cR, for the links to Victor’s tribute to Marcella.

Winner! My husband loved it. As far as how many does it serve, well, uh, it depends on how much you want to pig out. Paul and I ate 2/3 of it with a nice hearty red wine. Yum. I used 2 1/2 t. pepper. It seemed a bit pepper-heavy, which blocked out the taste of the cheeses. I will use less next time. I am not a fan of pecorino (sorry, everyone!) so I substituted Toscano, which was wonderful. I also used fresh organic basil and parsley (no rabe). Very good and pretty too! Thank you Deb. You obviously hit it out of the park (or should I say pantry) on this one!

It was a delicious way to use the leftover pasta from the night before. It is still one of my favorites made by my Nonna and my mother as well. Our family’s tradition is to use the leftover pasta with red meat sauce mixed in, add some diced  thick-cut cooked pancetta or even dried sweet italian sausage bits, along with egg, a bit of milk and cheese. Mix it up throw it in a cast iron pan and cook on stove on low til starts to set, then finish in the oven. I do love the idea of adding some greens though!

And because I couldn’t find the 9″ springform pan (where IS that thing hiding?!), I baked this in a tube pan and the unexpected upside was more crispy edges, which was my favorite part.\\n\\n\\n103\\n\\nThis was easy and so incredibly good.

      "{'_index': 'cooking', '_type': '_doc', '_id': 'udn5H2QB7PzBcXb-nYH5', '_score': 1.0, '_source': {'description': '\\n\\n[Photographs: Vicky Wasik]\\n\\nWhat do my redheaded partner, Kate, and the spicy tomato sauce arrabbiata have in common? Easy: They both look innocent enough, but watch out, because underneath lies a fiery streak that, when unleashed, will leave you wondering what you did to invite such an assault.\\n\\nAnd, I\\'ll be honest, I love them both for it.\\n\\nThe one big difference, though, is that with Kate, I don\\'t always get to choose when she breathes fire*, while, with arrabbiata, I can decide not only when I\\'m willing to take the heat but also exactly how much heat I\\'m willing to take. That\\'s really the main thing to know about arrabbiata, because otherwise it\\'s a dead-simple sauce—tomato sauce, made spicy enough to deserve its \"angry\" name.\\n\\n* Well, unless you consider not listening, not asking thoughtful follow-up questions, and not holding up my end of the conversation a choice.\\n\\nYou have two main decisions, therefore, when making arrabbiata. The first is what kind of tomato sauce you want to use, and the other is how spicy you want to make it.\\n\\nFor the first part, you have several options. Most of the time, and particularly during colder months when tomatoes are out of season, I use canned whole tomatoes, which I crush by hand to form a chunky sauce. You could also purée them for a smoother sauce, if that\\'s more appealing. They are far better than any hothouse tomato out there.\\n\\nIf you do find good tomatoes at the market, it\\'s worth considering fresh instead. That might mean cooking diced ripe tomatoes in the oil just until they start to break down, or making a coulis from fresh tomatoes, or even using a more involved fresh sauce, like the one I devised a couple of years ago.\\n\\nThe spice level is a highly personal decision, which makes precise measurements in a recipe difficult. Not only do different people have wildly different heat tolerances, but different chilies, whether fresh or dried, can have a broad range of intensities. So really, the ball\\'s in your court there. You know how hot your chilies are, and you know how much heat you can handle, so act accordingly.\\n\\nThat said, I would encourage you to push the heat level to the edge of what you can tolerate. After all, this isn\\'t \"mildly annoyed\" sauce or \"kinda peeved\" sauce, and it\\'s definitely not \"you\\'re starting to make me cross\" sauce. No, it\\'s \"angry\" sauce. I think you want to aim just below \"frothing at the mouth\" and just above \"pissed off.\" It\\'s a sauce that should look you in the eyes right before you take your first bite and say, with a sad and futile earnestness, \"Don\\'t make me angry...you wouldn\\'t like me when I\\'m angry\"—even though you both know, deep down in your bones, that it\\'s a fait accompli. Bruce Banner will become the Hulk, and arrabbiata shall fulfill its destiny, too.\\n\\n\\n\\nMaking it starts out just like a typical aglio, olio, e peperoncino, gently cooking garlic and red pepper flakes in oil to extract their heat and flavor, except that here you\\'re going heavy on the red pepper.\\n\\n\\n\\nNext, add the tomatoes in whatever form you\\'ve chosen, and simmer it all together. Guess what? You\\'re done! Well, almost. You should probably season it with a little salt.\\n\\nAt this point, you can finish your pasta in it. Here, I\\'ve gone with penne, a common arrabbiata choice, but all sorts of shapes will work. The rest of the process follows the classic way of finishing pasta in its sauce.\\n\\n\\n\\nWe do that by heating the sauce in a skillet. (If you\\'ve just made the sauce, it\\'ll already be hot and in the skillet.) Then transfer the cooked pasta to the sauce, along with a few tablespoons of its cooking water. If you ignore the common advice to use a huge pot of water and go with a smaller pot instead, you\\'ll end up with starchier water, which will help bind the sauce better.\\n\\nOnce the sauce has reduced enough that it doesn\\'t look watery anymore, go ahead and remove it from the heat, then quickly stir in cheese. I toss in some chopped parsley at this point, too.\\n\\n\\n\\nThat\\'s it, ready to eat. Couldn\\'t be easier. It\\'s so easy, in fact, that the only emotion you should be feeling is pure, unadulterated happiness. The only thing that shouldn\\'t be happy in this situation is the pasta in the bowl.\\n'}}\n",

Eggs, salads and baked goods all need to be prepared either just before people arrive, or just before you sit down to eat. You can help the eggs along by making a breakfast casserole, but you can save even more time by preparing this fantastic Overnight Coffee Cake. The coffee cake – and you can get the recipe over on the Craftsy blog (it’s free!) – and the streusel are both prepared the night before you intend to bake and the assembled cake is refrigerated until it is ready to go in the oven. The resulting cake has a soft, even crumb and just the right amount of crunchy streusel topping. Your guests will never know how much time you saved (or that you got to sleep in for an extra hour!) by serving up this amazing cake.\\n\\nIf you prefer nuts in your coffee cake, you can stir in about a 1/2 cup or so of finely chopped nuts while preparing the batter.

And since frozen fruit works just as well (if not better — hello, icy, creamy texture), there's no worry about whether it's in season.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\t   If you're stuck in the doldrums of gray days, try these tropical smoothies. It won't be quite like you're relaxing on a white-sand beach, but it'll be closer to it than your normal bowl of oatmeal.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\t         Sometimes, you just have to go with a classic. This smoothie recipe is one of our standbys. We might dress it up or down with a touch of mint or swap in coconut water, but we can always count on it to be delicious.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\t         You'll definitely get bonus points if you use a fresh coconut to make this smoothie. But because we know mornings are hectic, you can also swap in a can of coconut milk, and it will be just as creamy and delicious.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\t        Adding mint to your smoothie is a total pro move. Not only does it amplify the fresh taste, but it also makes it feel slightly more like dessert than a healthy breakfast. This smoothie also has a pinch of sea salt to boost all the other flavors.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\t       Don't be fooled by the nondescript hue of this smoothie; it's packed full of tropical flavors including banana, pineapple, mango, and ginger. Plus it gets an added texture from the chia seeds that are mixed in.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\t      This rich smoothie is perfect for cooler weather, thanks to the warming spices like cardamom and cinnamon. But before you think it'll taste too much like banana bread, there's a squeeze of lime juice mixed in for a bit of brightness.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\t     If you like cilantro, this should be the next smoothie recipe that you try. The subtle spice of the cilantro offsets the sweetness of the pineapple and banana and starts your morning off with an herby kick.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\t         Not only does this smoothie get a nutritional boost from fresh (or ground) turmeric, but it also has oats as its base to give it a nice dairy-free creamy consistency.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\t    This is the perfect way to use up any of those kiwis that you had the best of intentions of using, but that have been languishing on your counter for just a touch too long. Blend them up with coconut milk, avocado, and some lemon juice (along with water and ice) and you'll end up with a delicious and creamy breakfast.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\t        If you have a restricted diet, this is the smoothie template to try. It relies on silken tofu for creaminess, agave syrup for sweetness, and soy milk for smoothness. The only decision you have to make is what kind of fruit to mix in.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\t         If you want to make mornings even easier on yourself, try prepping your smoothie ingredients for the week over the weekend and stashing them in the freezer. Then all you have to do is blend and go.

Such an awesome root.\\xa0Really affordable to buy, filled with flavour and so versatile to use. Plus, it’s thick, wrinkly, handle cold temperatures well and can therefor be harvested all through the winter. We had some celeriac left in the fridge after we had made this dish and used some of those leftovers to make thin and crispy celeriac chips and chopped the rest into a carrot & celeriac soup that, with a dash of white wine, was right on point.\\n\\nBut we are not here for\\xa0the leftovers, are we? We are here because of this little vegan lasagna made on thinly shaved celeriac and parsnip “noodles” that are layered with a tomato & lentil sauce, mushrooms\\xa0and spinach\\xa0and then covered with cherry tomatoes and baked until soft.\\xa0For a long time we\\xa0refused to call it lasagna, as we know that people can be a little cranky with words. The\\xa0recipe is made entirely without\\xa0lasagna noodles and béchamel sauce which probably is what technically makes a lasagna. But in the end we just thought lasagna sounded more appealing than casserole\\xa0and it also gives a more\\xa0visual description\\xa0of how this dish is layered. Our little gif animation further down in this post, also helps with that.\\n\\nRegardless of its name, this is\\xa0damn tasty\\xa0and perfect winter food. The roots don’t soak up liquid like lasagna so it stays juicy without the need to add a creamy sauce. However, if you\\xa0feel like throwing some dairy\\xa0into it, we can recommend whisking a good ricotta with some lemon juice\\xa0and spreading it out\\xa0as an extra layer in the\\xa0middle.\\n\\n\\n\\nReplacing lasagna noodles with thinly sliced celeriac is a\\xa0great little trick that unfortunately was not invented by us. There are a bunch of recipes out there, from Gordon Ramsey’s double cream version\\xa0to Sarah Britton’s\\xa0with butternut squash.\\n\\n\\n\\nOn another note, yesterday\\xa0we put a major\\xa0deadline behind us (which is why we have been so slow with new blog recipes).

Add onion, garlic and chili flakes and sauté for a couple of minutes. Add the rest of the ingredients\\xa0and stir to combine. Cover with a lid and let simmer for about 45 minutes, until the lentils are soft and the sauce is quite ‘dry’.\\n\\nPreparing the celeriac and parsnip lasagna noodles: Rinse the roots well, then peel, you might want to use a knife instead of a peeler. Cut the roots in halves (or quarters if it’s large). Slice it in very thin slices, best and easiest done with a mandolin slicer (3 mm slices). Alternatively use a sharp knife, but be careful, and slice as thin as possible.\\n\\nPreparing the mushrooms: Clean the mushrooms\\xa0with a soft brush (baking brush or toothbrush), if they are very dirty wash them with a little water and dry well. Slice the stem and the cap lengthwise into large pieces. Heat oil and garlic in a skillet on medium-high heat, add mushrooms\\xa0and\\xa0for a couple of minutes until browned on one side, then stir. Fry for a couple more minutes and pour into a bowl. Now add the thawed spinach to the same skillet with out rinsing. When heated, set aside.\\n\\n\\n\\nAssembling the lasagna: In an oven proof dish, start with a thin layer of oil, cover with a layer of root ‘noodles’. Add a layer of half of the tomato sauce and cover with a layer of root ‘noodles’. Add a layer of mushrooms +\\xa0spinach and a layer of root ‘noodles’. Add a layer of the remaining tomato sauce and arrange the sliced tomatoes on top to cover the tomato sauce.

It’s unfancy food at its best, as should be no surprise from the woman who was very distressed by complicated chefs’ recipes, wondering \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSo when I first saw Food & Wine’s Cacio e Pepe Pasta Pie on Pinterest earlier this month, as one does, my first thought was “Oooh, so impossible-to-achieve outside a food styling studio pretty,” (because, I mean, look at it) followed by “Wait, that’s not cacio e pepe” (a Roman dish with exactly three ingredients — pecorino, black pepper and spaghetti, usually fresh tonnarelli, and if you can forgive me for being pedantic, definitely no cheddar), followed by “Wouldn’t all of that egg custard leak from my springform?” (answer: yes, and woe is my oven floor) and then “I wonder what Marcella Hazan would have thought of this.” Would she have been distraught by the springform, perturbed by the use of three types of cheese, shaking her head over the finish under the broiler?\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nWell, if she’s anything like the rest of us, I think she’d be too busy enjoying it to ask such questions because this dish — which I’d liken to the halfway point between a spaghetti frittata and a spaghetti quiche — is spectacular. I made it on a whim a couple weeks ago (because that’s my thing these days) and even though my peeling wood-veneer kitchen counter is the furthest cry from a photography studio, it was a total stunner. And while this is unequivocally comfort food — pasta, eggs, and a glorious amount of cheese, yesss — something about eating it in tall wedges with a green salad felt almost civilized, humble food raised to its most centerpiece-worthy calling, and all from just a handful of ingredients. We’re going to be making this a lot this winter, I can tell.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nOne year ago: Caramelized Onion and Gruyere Biscuits\\nTwo years ago: Homemade Dulce de Leche\\nThree years ago: Intensely Chocolate Sables\\nFour years ago: Potato Chip Cookies\\nFive years ago: Roast Chicken with Dijon Sauce\\nSix years ago: Black Bean Soup with Toasted Cumin Seed Crema + Cranberry Syrup and an Intensely Almond Cake\\nSeven years ago: Mushroom Bourguignon and Sugar Puffs\\nEight years ago: Leek and Swiss Chard Tart\\nNine years ago: Grapefruit Yogurt Cake and Pasta with Sausage Tomatoes and Mushrooms\\n\\nAnd for the other side of the world:\\nSix Months Ago: Tomato and Fried Provolone Sandwich\\n1.5 Years Ago: Bourbon Slush Punch\\n2.5 Years Ago: Mama Canales-Garcia’s Avocado Shrimp Salsa\\n3.5 Years Ago: Zucchini Bread Pancakes\\n4.5 Years Ago: Corn, Buttermilk and Chive Popovers\\n\\n\\nSpaghetti Pie with Pecorino and Black Pepper\\nAdapted from Justin Chapple at Food & Wine\\n\\nThis pie plays off the flavors of classic cacio e pepe — these flavors will be, delightfully, the strongest — but, of course, I fiddled with it a little. The first time, I made it with 8 ounces each of pecorino romano and fontina (because although I love cheddar, I just couldn’t). The second time, I made with less of each (which was a mistake) and because I’ve become That Person, the kind of person that needs to see some green before I can allow something to become a regular meal, I added about a cup of blanched and finely chopped broccoli rabe (which was not). That said, while we enjoyed our green-flecked spaghetti wedges, we agreed we’d have liked it just as much with the greens on the side, preferably in a garlicky and pepper flake sauteed heap. \\n\\nA few important cooking notes: You must wrap your springform tightly in foil or you and your oven floor will end up in a very bad mood. Please (I beg here) cook your pasta until it’s a good two minutes from done as it will continue cooking in the oven and mushy pasta makes me sad. The greens here are optional (see above) but keep in mind that if you add them, you’ll want to do your best to remove every extra drop of moisture and anticipate that it will take longer to set. Finally, to me, good aged pecorino (usually sold with a black rind) makes all the difference here in providing a salty, funky kick. You can use parmesan if it’s all you’ve got, but you might find that you need more salt if you do.\\n\\u2003\\nButter for greasing springform\\n1/2 pound broccoli rabe, toughest stems saved for another use, chopped into few-inch segments (optional)\\n1 pound dried spaghetti\\n1 1/2 cups milk\\n3 large eggs, lightly beaten\\n2 to 3 teaspoons ground black pepper\\n2 teaspoons coarse or kosher salt\\n8 ounces aged pecorino cheese, finely grated, divided\\n8 ounces fontina cheese, grated, divided\\n\\nHeat oven to 425 degrees. Butter a 9-inch springform pan and this is very important, wrap the outside of the springform, focusing on the places where the ring meets the base, tightly in aluminum foil. Set aside.\\n\\nBring a large pot of well-salted water to a boil. If using broccoli rabe, add it to the pot and boil for 1 to 2 minutes, until it has some give. Fish it out with a large slotted spoon and drain it well. Set aside.\\n\\nAdd spaghetti to boiling water and cook until (this is also important) 2 minutes shy of done, so very al dente, as the spaghetti will continue cooking in the oven. Drain well and let cool slightly.\\n\\nIf using broccoli rabe, wring all extra moisture out of it and blot greens on paper towels to be extra careful. Mince rabe into very small bits. You’ll have about 1 cup total.\\n\\nIn a large bowl, whisk eggs and milk together with salt and pepper. Stir in all but 1/2 cup of each cheese and chopped rabe, if using. Add spaghetti and toss to coat. \\n\\nPour into prepared springform and sprinkle remaining cheese on top. Bake for 35 to 40 minutes (without greens) and up to 15 minutes more (with greens, as they add moisture too), until the cheese is melted and bubbling and a knife inserted into the center of the pie and turned slightly will not release any loose egg batter into the center. If the top of your pie browns too quickly before the center is set, cover it with foil for the remaining cooking time.\\n\\nTurn on your oven’s broiler. Broil the pie a few inches from the heat for 2 to 3 minutes, until browned on top. Cut along springform ring to loosen, then remove ring. Run a spatula underneath the pie to loosen the base and slide onto a serving plate. Cut into wedges.\\n\\nSee more: Casserole, Italian, Pasta, Photo, Vegetarian, Winter \\n\\nDo more: Link | Bookmark \\n | Pin | Print\\n | Email\\n | 136 Comments\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAD\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\xa0\\n\\t\\t\\tJanuary 26, 2016\\n1\\nCan this be made in a cast iron skillet, or does it require a springform pan?\\n\\n\\n1\\n\\nCan this be made in a cast iron skillet, or does it require a springform pan?\\n\\n\\ndeb\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\xa0\\n\\t\\t\\tJanuary 26, 2016\\n2\\nAD — I suspect it would be just fine in a cast-iron skillet, but you might be safest going to a 10-inch as they can be less tall than springforms.\\n\\n\\n2\\n\\nAD — I suspect it would be just fine in a cast-iron skillet, but you might be safest going to a 10-inch as they can be less tall than springforms.\\n\\n\\nAllie\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\xa0\\n\\t\\t\\tJanuary 26, 2016\\n3\\nIf I were able to get around my city (DC) without careening into huge snow banks today, I’d rush out and get these ingredients right now… it’s stunning! \\nAlso, just a little sidebar speaking of Marcella Hazan… have you ever tried her smothered cabbage or smothered cabbage and rice soup?

A tip for the leaky springform pan is to cut a slightly bigger round of parchment paper and lock the springform pan over it so that it acts like a washer in a faucet, but you must use one with the outer lip as shown in the photos above. Only a bead of cheese sauce will ooze out. I am afraid Martha Stewart’s latest cheesecake pan only at Macy’s  is the easiest solution. With a  normal springform pan the leakage can seep under the cavity under the overturned bottom (so there is no lip to catch the product after baking) filling it up. In any case always use a parchment round in the upside down bottom of a cheesecase pan—you can then just slide off the finished result.\\n\\n\\n31\\n\\nThis is called a “timballo”, similar to Food and Wine, May 2015, Justin Chapple: Cacio e Pepe Pasta Pie (yes, it has white cheddar and fontina besides the pecorino, but it works, this is quite different from the classic cacio e pepe pasta).

I still make this once or twice a winter, and my guests are always freaked out when they see the slice with the red sauce peeking through.

It was a delicious way to use the leftover pasta from the night before. It is still one of my favorites made by my Nonna and my mother as well. Our family’s tradition is to use the leftover pasta with red meat sauce mixed in, add some diced  thick-cut cooked pancetta or even dried sweet italian sausage bits, along with egg, a bit of milk and cheese. Mix it up throw it in a cast iron pan and cook on stove on low til starts to set, then finish in the oven. I do love the idea of adding some greens though! Love it for breakfast cold….yum.\\n\\n\\n90\\n\\nBeing raised in Italian households, spaghetti pie wasn’t something you made fresh.

And because I couldn’t find the 9″ springform pan (where IS that thing hiding?!), I baked this in a tube pan and the unexpected upside was more crispy edges, which was my favorite part.\\n\\n\\n103\\n\\nThis was easy and so incredibly good.

I think I just saw it on your Instagram and I HAD to make it; it just looked to good not to.  It turned out super delish, but I have to say that I made a few changes: I mixed in about 2 tbsp of chopped parsley and another for sprinkling over the top; I used parmesan instead of the pecorino and 1/2 mozzarella, 1/2 white cheddar (a very nice Vermont cheddar), for purely economic reasons. This is a true keeper! Had it with a simple spinach salad. I get to eat my other wedge for lunch tomorrow…ha ha! Also, I followed your instructions with the foil, and there was still about 1/3 of a cup of the custard that spilled out. Trying to think of a way to keep that from happening. Thank you much for the recipe. It turned out pretty, too!  :-)\\n\\n\\n135\\n\\nI made it! I think I just saw it on your Instagram and I HAD to make it; it just looked to good not to.

I’m back from another week in Charleston where I was shooting the second half of my new cookbook, Skinnytaste Fast and Slow (comes out this Fall). While there I did a book signing at the Charleston Wine + Food Festival, got to try some new restaurants and did some sight seeing, if you haven’t been there yet it’s a must!\\xa0 \\n\\nThis is\\xa0week 20 of sharing my weekly dinner plans. I use\\xa0The Skinnytaste Meal Planner\\xa0pictured below to plan my dinners for the week (you can of course use any meal planner).\\xa0\\n\\n\\nA\\n 52-week\\xa0meal planner,\\xa0food tracker and exercise tracker in one.\\xa0I’ve\\nincluded the Smart Points next to the recipes since I\\xa0am currently on\\nWeight Watchers. Also, if you have\\xa0The Skinnytaste Cookbook, and currently on Weight Watchers, I have all the Smart Points\\xa0listed here\\xa0for your convenience.Meal planning is\\xa0a great way to get organized before heading to the supermarket\\xa0to get ready\\xa0for the week!\\xa0My\\n breakfast is\\xa0usually\\xa0something quick like\\xa0eggs\\xa0with\\xa0fruit, a smoothie\\nor avocado toast. We’re\\xa0a family of\\xa0four, so if a recipe\\xa0serves\\nmore,\\xa0it’s either\\xa0packed up for everyone’s lunch or eaten the next day as leftovers.\\xa0If you would like to see some of the previous week’s\\xa0dinner plans,\\xa0click here. \\n\\nSkinnytaste Dinner Plan (Week 20)\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSaturday:\\xa0 Date Night Out!\\n\\n\\xa0 \\n\\n\\n\\xa0 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSHOPPING LIST: \\n\\nCREAMY ASPARAGUS LEEK SOUP:\\n\\n2 lbs asparagus \\n\\nButter\\n\\n4 leeks\\n\\nGarlic\\n\\nReduced sodium chicken broth\\n\\nCreme Fraiche \\n\\nKosher salt\\n\\nFresh pepper\\n\\nChives- optional\\n\\nBELL PEPPER AND POTATO FRITTATA:\\n\\nGreen bell pepper\\n\\nEggs\\n\\nEgg whites\\n\\nKosher salt & pepper\\n\\nOlive oil\\n\\nShallots\\n\\nYukon gold potatoes\\n\\nGarlic powder\\n\\nPaprika\\n\\nSWEET POTATO IRISH NACHOS:\\n\\nCooking spray\\n\\nSweet potatoes \\n\\nOlive oil\\n\\nPaprika\\n\\nCayenne pepper\\n\\nGarlic powder\\n\\nCoarse salt and fresh cracked pepper\\n\\nBell pepper\\n\\nSharp shredded cheddar cheese\\n\\nPepper jack light cheese\\n\\nScallion\\n\\nJalapeño \\n\\nTomato\\n\\nCilantro\\n\\nSliced black olives (optional)\\n\\nSalsa\\n\\n\\nHONEY BALSAMIC GRILLED CHICKEN AND VEGETABLES:\\n\\n1 1/2lb boneless, skinless thin sliced chicken cutlets \\n\\nHomemade pesto ** (or store bought)\\n\\nGarlic\\n\\nRed pepper flakes\\n\\nLime\\n\\nOlive oil\\n\\nBalsamic vinegar\\n\\nRaw honey\\n\\nKosher salt\\n\\nAsparagus \\n\\nZucchini\\n\\nRed bell pepper\\n\\nOlive oil cooking spray\\n\\n\\n**Skinny Basil Pesto:\\n\\nBasil\\n\\nGarlic\\n\\nGrated Parmesan \\n\\nSalt & pepper\\n\\nOlive oil\\n\\n\\nCROCK POT CORNED BEEF AND CABBAGE:\\n\\n2lbs Corned beef brisket\\n\\nFrozen pearl onions\\n\\nCarrots\\n\\nParsnips\\n\\nCabbage (small head)\\n\\nFresh parsley\\n\\nBay leaves\\n\\nWhole peppercorns\\n\\n\\nCREAMY CAULIFLOWER PURÉE:\\n\\nCauliflower (medium head)\\n\\nGarlic\\n\\nButtermilk\\n\\nSalt and pepper\\n\\nWhipped butter\\n\\nSHEPHERD’S PIE, LIGHTENED UP:\\n\\nYukon gold potatoes\\n\\nFat free chicken broth\\n\\nReduced fat sour cream\\n\\nPaprika\\n\\n1lb 95% lean ground beef\\n\\nOil\\n\\nOnion\\n\\nCelery\\n\\nGarlic\\n\\nMushrooms\\n\\nFrozen mixed vegetables \\n\\nFlour\\n\\nFat free beef broth\\n\\nTomato paste\\n\\nWorcestershire sauce\\n\\nFresh rosemary leaves \\n\\nFresh thyme leaves\\n\\nKosher salt and pepper\\n\\n\\nCORNED BEEF AND CABBAGE SOUP:\\n\\nolive oil\\n\\n2 leeks\\n\\ngarlic\\n\\n3 medium carrots\\n\\n1 yellow pepper\\n\\n1 lb lean corned beef brisket \\n\\nbay leaves\\n\\nparsley \\n\\n1 small head cabbage\\n\\n1 yukon gold large potato\\n\\n\\n\\t\\t\\tposted March 12, 2016 by Gina\\n\\n\\n\\n'}}\n"
