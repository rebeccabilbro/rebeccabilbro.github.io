    "## Document Distance\n",
    "Short intro to document similarity - finding a way to represent the distance between documents. \n",
    "\n",
    "Two things needed:\n",
    " - The first is to encode the documents as vectors. There are options for this (one-hot, frequency, distributed). \n",
    " - The second is to decide how to measure distance - Euclidean? Manhattan? Cosine? There are tradeoffs but cosine is a good place to start with text. Why? Documents encoded as vectors are sparse; each vector could be as long as the number of unique words across the full corpus.  That means that two documents of very different lengths (e.g. a single recipe and a cookbook), could be encoded with the same length vector, which might overemphasize the magnitude of the book's document vector at the expense of the recipe's document vector. Cosine distance helps to correct for variations in vector magnitudes resulting from uneven length documents, and enables us to measure the distance between the book and recipe.\n",
    " \n",
    "Document similarity is something we cover in the book - in chapter 6 and then in chapter 10 where we build a chatbot that, among other things, uses a nearest neigbor search to recommend recipes that are similar to the ingredients listed by the user. One of my observations during the prototyping phase for that chapter is how slow vanilla nearest neighbor search is. This led me to think about different ways to optimize the search, from using variations like k-ball, to using other Python libraries like Spotify's Annoy, and also to other kind of tools altogether that attempt to deliver a similar results as quickly as possible. Like ElasticSearch!\n",

      "Smoothies are one of our favorite breakfast options year-round, but especially in the winter because it's an easy way to brighten the mornings by adding extra fruit to our diets. And since frozen fruit works just as well (if not better — hello, icy, creamy texture), there's no worry about whether it's in season. If you're stuck in the doldrums of gray days, try these tropical smoothies. It won't be quite like you're relaxing on a white-sand beach, but it'll be closer to it than your normal bowl of oatmeal. Sometimes, you just have to go with a classic. This smoothie recipe is one of our standbys. We might dress it up or down with a touch of mint or swap in coconut water, but we can always count on it to be delicious. You'll definitely get bonus points if you use a fresh coconut to make this smoothie. But because we know mornings are hectic, you can also swap in a can of coconut milk, and it will be just as creamy and delicious. Adding mint to your smoothie is a total pro move. Not only does it amplify the fresh taste, but it also makes it feel slightly more like dessert than a healthy breakfast. This smoothie also has a pinch of sea salt to boost all the other flavors. Don't be fooled by the nondescript hue of this smoothie; it's packed full of tropical flavors including banana, pineapple, mango, and ginger. Plus it gets an added texture from the chia seeds that are mixed in. This rich smoothie is perfect for cooler weather, thanks to the warming spices like cardamom and cinnamon. But before you think it'll taste too much like banana bread, there's a squeeze of lime juice mixed in for a bit of brightness. If you like cilantro, this should be the next smoothie recipe that you try. The subtle spice of the cilantro offsets the sweetness of the pineapple and banana and starts your morning off with an herby kick. Not only does this smoothie get a nutritional boost from fresh (or ground) turmeric, but it also has oats as its base to give it a nice dairy-free creamy consistency. This is the perfect way to use up any of those kiwis that you had the best of intentions of using, but that have been languishing on your counter for just a touch too long. Blend them up with coconut milk, avocado, and some lemon juice (along with water and ice) and you'll end up with a delicious and creamy breakfast. If you have a restricted diet, this is the smoothie template to try. It relies on silken tofu for creaminess, agave syrup for sweetness, and soy milk for smoothness. The only decision you have to make is what kind of fruit to mix in. If you want to make mornings even easier on yourself, try prepping your smoothie ingredients for the week over the weekend and stashing them in the freezer. Then all you have to do is blend and go. Just watch how easy it is: (Image credits: Emily Han; Faith Durand; Chris Perez; Michaela Cisney; Megan Gordon; Sarah Rae Smith; Abe Martinez)\n"

      "When Elise and Ben bought their Mount Washington house, the kitchen looked like this. They used this sad kitchen for five years until they finally updated it. The end result is modernized, but still captures the spirit and integrity of the storied older house. Using IKEA cabinets to keep the costs down, they were able to upgrade and personalize the look with Calcutta marble and Schoolhouse Electric hardware for all the cabinets. And what an amazing transformation after: More details to drool over: In Elise's words: I probably made about 12 different floor plans and elevations trying to fit everything in, yet achieve a light, open, airy feeling. The biggest issues were the appliances. How do you fit these huge things, plus a ton of storage space, into a 10x10 room? Really, the only solution was to downsize as much as possible and get a a little creative with the old \"kitchen triangle.\" Breaking up the cooktop and oven, forgoing a good looking oven hood and for a sensible micro hood, and getting the narrowest refrigerator we could find/afford (even if that meant it wasn't counter depth) ended up making the most sense. What we ended up doing: Removed a wall between our tiny kitchen and mud room to make one larger kitchen and create a peninsula for the kids to sit and eat. Removed and replace acoustic ceiling tiles with skim coated drywall Replaced two louvered windows with one awning window IKEA cabinets and fronts in the high gloss white. I looked into both Semi Handmade and Kokeena but because of budget and timing we stuck with IKEA DIY Brass toe kicks Solid Brass hardware Calacutta Marble countertops/backsplash/waterfall White Oak wood floors IKEA refrigerator, microwave and cooktop Smeg oven Elise also has a more DIY tips and details on their kitchen remodel on her blog Burke Decor Blog. She was also gracious enough to share a few valuable lessons she learned during the process of renovating their kitchen using IKEA → Stress-Saving IKEA Kitchen Reno Lessons from a Real Homeowner The surprise that Elise found during renovation was unreal. The house she bought had tenants who lived there for 50 years. It turns out that the previous resident Ruby also wanted new cabinets just as bad as Elise! Thank you Ben and Elise!
